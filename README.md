# mini_elf_checker

About
This project is to reinforce the concept that information = bits + context.
Opening a binary file and verifying that it is a valid Mini-ELF file based on its header. Also print its contents based on contextual information, first as simply a series 
of bytes and then according to the file's format. The file is formatted in a simplified version of the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) used to store relocatable object files 
in Linux.
